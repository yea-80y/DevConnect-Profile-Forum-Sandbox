# DevConnect Profile + Forum Sandbox

A proof-of-concept application demonstrating **Swarm-hosted user profiles** and a **decentralised message board**.

It shows how to use Swarm (Bee), Swarm Feeds, and EIP-712/EIP-191 signatures to create user-owned identities and cryptographically verified posts — all without a traditional backend database.

> **Status:** Work-in-progress / pre-launch. Deployment details and live URLs will be added once available.

## Quick Start

### 1) Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yea-80y/DevConnect-Profile-Forum-Sandbox.git
cd DevConnect-Profile-Forum-Sandbox
npm install
```

### 2) Create a local environment file

Create a file named `.env.local` in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# Bee / Swarm node configuration
BEE_URL=http://localhost:1633              # Server-side Bee URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_BEE_URL=http://localhost:1633  # Client-side Bee URL (browser)

# Postage and feeds (server-side)
POSTAGE_BATCH_ID=your_postage_batch_id     # Required for uploads/feed writes
FEED_PRIVATE_KEY=0xabc123...               # Platform feed signer (hex private key)

# Optional values
ENS_DOMAIN=your-site.eth.limo              # Optional: ENS domain (future deployment)
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Explanation of required values:**

- `BEE_URL` — URL of your Bee node or trusted gateway used by the server.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BEE_URL` — Bee URL exposed to the browser for GET requests.
- `POSTAGE_BATCH_ID` — A valid postage stamp batch for uploads and feed writes.
- `FEED_PRIVATE_KEY` — Private key of the platform signer account (signs feeds).
- `ENS_DOMAIN` — Optional, only used if you plan to resolve your site via ENS.

> Do **not** commit `.env.local` to version control.

### 3) Start the development server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yea-80y/DevConnect-Profile-Forum-Sandbox.git
cd DevConnect-Profile-Forum-Sandbox
npm install
2) Create a local environment file
Create a file named .env.local in the project root with the following variables:

env
Copy code
# Bee / Swarm node configuration
BEE_URL=http://localhost:1633              # Server-side Bee URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_BEE_URL=http://localhost:1633  # Client-side Bee URL (browser)

# Postage and feeds (server-side)
POSTAGE_BATCH_ID=your_postage_batch_id     # Required for uploads/feed writes
FEED_PRIVATE_KEY=0xabc123...               # Platform feed signer (hex private key)

# Optional values
ENS_DOMAIN=your-site.eth.limo              # Optional: ENS domain (future deployment)
NODE_ENV=development
Explanation of required values:

BEE_URL — URL of your Bee node or trusted gateway used by the server.

NEXT_PUBLIC_BEE_URL — Bee URL exposed to the browser for GET requests.

POSTAGE_BATCH_ID — A valid postage stamp batch for uploads and feed writes.

FEED_PRIVATE_KEY — Private key of the platform signer account (signs feeds).

ENS_DOMAIN — Optional, only used if you plan to resolve your site via ENS.

⚠️ Do not commit .env.local to version control.

3) Start the development server
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## How It Works (Overview)

- **Reads (GET):** The browser fetches directly from Bee (`/feeds`, `/bytes`, `/bzz`) to display profiles, posts, and avatars.
- **Writes (POST):** The server API (with the platform signer and postage batch) uploads immutable JSON blobs and updates Swarm feeds.
- **Login / Auth:** Web3 users sign an **EIP-712** capability; posts are signed with **EIP-191** and verified before publishing.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is included in the `docs/` folder:

- **System Components** — overview of architecture and deployment: `./docs/System-Components.pdf`
- **Forum Architecture & Flows** — login, profile feeds, posting, replies: `./docs/Forum-Architecture.pdf`

---

## Development Notes

- A **Bee node or gateway** must be running and reachable.
- A valid **postage batch** is required for uploads and feed writes.
- Server-side posting and moderation require `FEED_PRIVATE_KEY` and `POSTAGE_BATCH_ID`.
- Client-side reads depend on `NEXT_PUBLIC_BEE_URL`. Update this to a public gateway if needed.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Deployment instructions for Bee gateway and ENS
- [ ] Optional: support user-provided postage batches
- [ ] Production hardening (rate limiting, spam prevention)
